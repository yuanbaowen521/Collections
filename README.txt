Directory Enhancers includes the collections of enhancers, super-enhancers and their related genes
super_enhancer_collection.bed are downloaded from the papaer: Master Transcription Factors and Mediator Establish Super-Enhancers at Key Cell Identity Genes. (2013) 
This file contains .bed files for superenhancers in ESCs, pro-B cells,myotubes, Th cells, and macrophages. This file is a UCSC genome browser .bed format file (http://genome.ucsc.edu) containing the genomic coordinates for all super-enhancers in profiled cell lines. Coordinates are in genome build mm9. Individual tracks are provided for super-enhancers in each cell line. 
enhancer_super_genes_txt_format containing 86 files, each containing stitched enhancers, associated genes, and ChIP-seq signal. Columns are: enhancer ID, chromosome, start, end, associated gene, enhancer rank, is enhancer a super-enhancer (1:yes, 0:no), H3K27ac ChIP-seq density (rpm/bp), read density in corresponding input sample (rpm/bp).
enhancer_super_genes_bed_format containing 86 files, each a pair of UCSC Genome Browser tracks. Tracks displayed in black are all stitched enhancers. Tracks displayed in red are superenhancers.
File_document.txt is a documkent of these 86 files.

Also, the website http://162.129.231.130/EnhancerAtlas/link.php provides more information about enhancers.
